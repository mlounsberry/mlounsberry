- Hi, I’m Mike Lounsberry (@Mike_Lounsberry on Twitter)
- I’m interested in football analytics and will be focusing on charting all punts in the NFL this year!
- I’m always attempting to learn more about Python and R.
- I’m looking to collaborate on football analytics projects, especially if they pertain to punting/special teams.
